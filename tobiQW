	'(You) - The owner Karin?'
	'(Toby) - Oh, holy simplicity. Of course, Karin saved you from the evil Toby and teach you magic. She Horoshoo and ugly Toby bad. What naivety. Karin is a pawn in someone else''s game.'
	'(Toby) - sit down, we have a long conversation to kill you I''m not going, if built, would not you sharpen fritters.'
	'You sat down on the bed. Toby began to talk.'
	'(Toby) - When I took the amulet is not taking you, I miscalculated, I did not know that the power passed to you. When I returned to the room, you were gone, there was no trace of who is clearly very well cleaned up all traces. This someone is not weaker than me. Remember this fact, Karin silenok not enough so close to me.'
	'(Toby) - The next day I find out about your alleged death. And here the owner Karin made his biggest mistake.'
	'(You) - what? Everything seems to go smoothly.'
	'(Toby) - Yes, all passed smoothly, we waited for the funeral of the body and then it got. Perfect copy, master work, Karin can not do it, but I did not even know about its existence.'
	'(Toby) - But the owner Karin though knows a lot about the Order of Dawn, but still not enough. He did not know that Payne has the ability to find the souls of the dead and bring them back to life. We got the body for life and it turned out that this man has nothing to do with you. Someone just took a passerby in the street, he created your appearance and killed him. Payne also has the ability to see everything in a person, even when he is born, and the eyes of this man, unfortunately it kills guinea spell. Payne saw everything.'
	'(You) - Nifiga yourself is that even for such Payne?'
	'(Toby) - Payne, the true owner of all that is in the tomb. He is a true master of the force that is in you. He avatar Rikudo, the living embodiment of God, capable of destroying the city in one motion, raise the dead, to see through people, to change their body as he pleases, to have as many bodies at the same time, control the weather, gravity, live in several worlds, to see whole continents his eyes so that even the mouse does not slip from his sight, and God knows what he owns, it is incomprehensible even to me.'

	'(You) - So who''s the boss and that Karin does he want?'
	'(Toby) - This is the fun part! But to continue in order. When Payne checked memory corpse depicting you, he did not see the face of magician, but I heard his voice, vile snake hiss, it could only be Orochimaru.'
	'(You) - Orochimaru? Never heard of such a thing.'
	'(Toby) - not surprising. He was not looking for that would head off to tear only dead mages and lazy. But his name did not even try to say out loud, and then suddenly courted him on his head, he is a real threat to the powerful magicians. We were once close friends with him, he was in the Dawn.'
	'(Toby) - He is an exceptionally gifted magician, a very wise, ancient and immortal sorcerer. Owns nearly all the possible techniques of magic, many of his techniques beyond comprehension.'
	'(Toby) - But Orochimaru pay dearly for immortality. There is no eternal life without eternal fee for it. His real body has long been dead, he lives in the wrong bodies. These bodies are called donor vessels, they receptacle of his soul. Vessels but do not live long, only three or four years, then the vessel rejects soul Orochimaru. And Orochimaru is limited by the strength of the vessel.'
	'(Toby) - So, after examination of the body, it became clear you out from under our nose led Orochimaru. We began to stalk him, Payne can differentiate amongst all that is in the rain, it was he who sheds it so often. We tracked down Orochimaru manner he once showed his face snake in the rain. But there was no sign that he took power himself. We have concluded that, as before, you alive, Orochimaru technology allow crank most unexpected focus.'
	'(You) - Since you tracked me and why I need Orochimaru.'
	'(Toby) - Ah youth stupid. Yes Orochimaru wants to make your body a vessel for the soul. He trained with the help of Karin and you developed, what would your body came into full force, do not forget, its level is tied to the strength of the vessel.'
	'(Toby) - Karin spit at you like, it develops your body for what would be her master Orochimaru could use it as a new vessel. Do you even know what fate has prepared for you, Karin? You just erase your place and take Orochimaru.'
	'You think "Damn, I''m in between a rock and a hard place Toby as Orochimaru, and what to do now?"'
	'(Toby) - To change your floor Orochimaru made you useless for Payne and me, we do not need you or do not need. Frankly, we spit on you now. I continued to look for you, but out of a desire to razobratsya situation. Understand Orochimaru plans to this effect.'
	'(Toby) - I had to use and Zetsu as a spy, and that would force Payne track all magicians, we found Karin, but it is not known to us, but we found Juugo, and only then we will know exactly what he represents. He experiment Orochimaru.'
	'(Toby) - Then Payne saw you. How do you go to Karin and she teaches you, Paine saw as you leap through the levels magicity. Any magician decades to grow your current level. How old are you this time it took? You were practicing a technique for an hour, and magicians for years they are taught. It became clear that you imagine yourself out. So I came to visit you.'

	'Toby shook his head.'
	'(Toby) - Do not think that magicians are all the same, if one could that something else can accurately. No, I have no idea how Orochimaru did what he did to you. And it was he, not Karin. Did not you surprised that she even treat you can not? It is too weak for such tricks with the body.'
	'(Toby) - And now to the point. Yeah, you''re not interested in us, we really can not take your power now. But this does not mean that we just give up such a powerful vessel Orochimaru.'
	'(Toby) - I would have already tried to kill Orochimaru, or sent Payne to do it, I think Payne would have easily killed him in battle. The problem is that Orochimaru is too great and he is able to avoid fighting.'

When the time comes, you go and kill Karin and Juugo. If it makes any of the Dawn who, Orochimaru all understand, and so he will try to grab you myself. He needs you as a vessel, and so it just did not unhook from you.'

	'(Toby) - We are all united by one goal, maintaining Tsukuemi in working order, for this we have to regularly catch demons in other worlds and fill them Tsukuemi force. It is heavy and rewarding work. And we do it for the sake of humanity that would have existed.'
	'(Toby) - Yes, you heard right, we do it for the sake of people. We remember the days when people knew about magic, it was a time of constant war, humanity choking blood. Magee went to war at the age of 6 - 10 years old, survived to at least 16 units. All fought against all. Violence begets violence. Me in 7 years during the battle crushed the right side of the face. I lost an eye and became compelled to hide what''s left of my face behind the mask. I went mighty magician, who was later killed. Everyone I knew and loved, killed, and I could not do anything about it. You just can not imagine a world in which almost all magicians with forces capable of destroying entire cities. Banal drunken brawl in a bar wrapped in a bloody mess with thousands of victims. People ran wild and destroy each other. Mankind fell on the edge of a precipice. Then I decided to put an end to this massacre not died.'
	'(Toby) - I founded the Order of Dawn. In the beginning we were just mercenaries, we needed money, we have taken in order only very strong mages, then I met Payne, he also wanted to stop the eternal war mages. We combined usliya captured demons and I created Tsukuemi.'
	'(Toby) - Tsukuemi makes people not believe in magic, it makes forget about it. Gradually reduced the number of magicians. And finally forgot about magic at all.'
	'(Toby) - Of course, this situation is not like the other magicians. Therefore, we are in a constant struggle. At Dawn has no friends, only enemies. We took upon themselves the burden and bear your cross for mankind as a whole.'

	'(Toby) - Tsukuemi makes people not believe in magic, it makes forget about it. Gradually reduced the number of magicians. And finally forgot about magic at all. I stripped the magic world of magic. People are not ready for this level of forces.'
	'(Toby) - Of course, this situation is not like the other magicians. Therefore, we are in a constant struggle. At Dawn has no friends, only enemies but we still have a whole bunch of magicians who managed to avoid the influence Tsukuemi example preserved a Hidden Order Foliage, they at every opportunity we try to insert a stick in the wheel. But we shouldered this burden voluntarily accept his cross for the sake of humanity as a whole, and not wanting to assert themselves a handful of magicians. Particularly zealous mages going to seize power we consume, those who try to intrude into the work Tsukuemi we also consume. Others do not touch until they climb on the rampage. Well, except for the order hidden in the foliage, with them we did not reconcilable war.'

Payne forces generally something otherworldly, what can you''ll be able to learn something from him, but not now. I wish that you would teach Kakuzu. But he has a very nasty character. He will not teach you for free, even if I asked. He is the oldest of living on the planet, and the most greedy, I will ask him what he would have taught you, but not anger him, and he will kill you, no joke. I''m not just saying that Kakuzu most harmful of all the old man living, he did not just kill his teammates. I forgive him everything only from the fact that he owns the only light at the same time by all schools of magic.'
	'(Toby) - Here is harmful to this old man, I want you to send. Find him in the northern region. Here''s a piece of paper with his address. And I have to go.'
